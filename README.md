Project Title: Hangman 

Description: This project will contain the code for a hangman game. The program will ask the user for an inout stating to enter a singular letter and check the validity of the guess for example, if the user eneters the value 'Be', the program will state that the input is invalid as we only want a singular letter from the user. We also want the program to determine whether the user input matches any letters in the random choice of word that the user needs to guess. The purpose of this project is to be able to use many diiferent programming techniques such as using classes, import libraries and many more.

Installation Instruction:
